<h1>My Journey to Software Development</h1>

  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can solve problems and improve people's lives. My journey to becoming a software developer began when I was 8 yrs old.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the primary motivations behind my decision to pursue a career in software development is to solve real life problems. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The potential to make a positive impact on the world through technology is also a driving force for me. I believe that software can be used to  create a better future for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the journey to becoming a software developer has its challenges, I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.
